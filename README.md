## Usage

## Goals of the project

In my life as a first year student at university I encountered the problems of living by yourself for the first time and
thought: "What if I had a toolkit that had all the things I need to make *insert task* easier?". For example I had trouble keeping
track of my expenses, finding which store has the best prices ect. I wanted to help myself and other students by solving a plethora of their problems - 
and that what "Student Life" is going to do.
